# Scriptables
A small repo containing all of my Scriptable scripts (iOS Automation API). 

### So what *is* [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/)? 
Scriptable is a mobile application for iOS created to enable the ordinary consumer to integrate with iOS' backend. Its simple syntax allows for lots of flexability. Scriptable uses *Javascript*. Scriptable of course also allows for developers to prototype, test, preview, and much more.  

Scriptable, according to their [website](https://scriptable.app/), currently consists of the following features: 
> **Plain Javascript** 
> - Supports JavaScript ES6. Scripts are stored as plain JS files on disk.  
>
> **Native APIs**
> - Integrate with the native APIs of iOS directly from JavaScript.  
>
> **Siri Shortcuts**
> - Run scripts from Siri Shortcuts. Present tables, websites, HTML and more in Siri.  
>
> **Documentation** 
> - All native APIs that are bridged to JavaScript have documentation which is available offline.  
>
> **Share Sheet Extension**
> - Run a script from a share sheet and process the inputs.  
>
> **Files Integration**
> - Integrated with the file system and Files.app enabling you to perform operations on files.  
>
> **Customizable**
> - The editor can be customized to match your preferences.  
>
> **Example scripts**
> - Comes with several example scripts to get you started.  
>
> **x-callback-url**
> - Communicate with other apps using x-callback-url.  

By using Scriptable, you have the benefit of easily integrating with iOS, the least dynamic OS on the planet, without the need for a Developer license; it's a great tool in my opinion.

### Why?  
I created this repository in hopes that it will inspire and/or help others with their journey as a developer. However, I also created this repository for my own benefit of gathering what I have created using this application into one standalone project â€” it's a win-win, really! Later, maybe even by the time you're reading this, I would like to use this project to create one of few (that I've seen), if any, tutorials to showcase what Scriptable is capable of, and to create inspiration from.
